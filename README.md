# CM1_DRM
The Dynamic reconstruction model was incoprated into Cloud model 1 in Shi et. al (2019).  
The example namelist are provided in directory "cm1r19.7-DRM/example_namelists"
The 1km_DRM0_ODD5 means 1km grid resolution, DRM0 means zero order of reconstruction of resolvable subfilter-scale (RSFS), ODD5 means simple fifth order advection scheme.
